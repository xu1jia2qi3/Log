# Log-Analysis

### Project Overview
>In this project, you'll work with data that could have come from a real-world web application, with fields representing information that a web server would record, such as HTTP status codes and URL paths. The web server and the reporting tool both connect to the same database, allowing information to flow from the web server into the report.
